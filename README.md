# Hospital Emergency Room (ER) Analysis

## Project Background

In this project the stakeholders are looking to monitor and analyze emergency room (ER) patient statistics to improve efficiency, reduce wait times, and enhance patient care. The data was collected from internal hospital databases (EHR, CRM, SQL systems) Patient feedback surveys (for satisfaction scores).

### Insights and recommendations are provided in the following key areas:

- How many patients visited the ER during a specific period? 
- What is the average wait time for ER patients?
- What is the patient satisfaction score?
- How many patients were admitted vs. not admitted?
- What percentage of patients were seen within 30 minutes?
- What are the demographics of ER patients (age, gender, race)? What are the busiest days and hours for ER visits?
- Which departments refer the most patients to the ER?
